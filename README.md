# Tokamak2010-OpenPhysics-
A open source Physics engine for Blitz3D.
This is my first publicly released open source project.
Posted in a german software development forum, called Blitz Basic Portal.
I posted it under my online alias as smr597, in 6'th march of 2010.
I am reposting this here, so that developers are able to take a look into it, without having to download the package.

To launch the examples, you need a Blitz3D program installed on your machine
Get it from here: https://blitzresearch.itch.io/blitz3d (formerly https://www.blitzbasic.com)
